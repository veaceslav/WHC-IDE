This is a basic list of recomendations before sending a patch/adding a commit

1. Project use camelCase, please don't use other styles

2. Every method from .h should have a comment in doxygen format, here is an example
    
    /**
     *  @brief method name - what it should do
     *  @param param1      - param 1 description
     *  @param param2      - param 2 description
     *  @return            - if function have return type, describe what method
     *                        return
     */

3. Never exceed the limit of 80 characters per line

4. Use int *a instead of int* a

5. Use /** Comment **/ instead of //Comment for one line comments

6. Always check if none of test fails after you changes, do not delete any test,
   fix it.

7. Intend with 4 spaces(no tabs)

8. Use Linux coding style:

    int function()
    {
        return 0;
    }
